"""
Build single-qubit calibration circuits for each qubit, then combine the results
to form a multi-qubit calibration matrix via tensor products.

We provide a standard approach:
    - For each qubit i:
        1) Prepare |0>, measure
        2) Prepare |1>, measure
    - Convert those results into a 2x2 matrix for that qubit:
        M_i = [[P(meas=0|prep=0), P(meas=1|prep=0)],
               [P(meas=0|prep=1), P(meas=1|prep=1)]]
    - For multiple qubits, the final matrix is the tensor product of each M_i.
